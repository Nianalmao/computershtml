    <h2>what is a computer composed of</h2>
    <p>a computer is a <strong>machine</strong> that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called <strong>programs</strong>. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</p>
    <p>a "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for <strong>"full"</strong> operation can be referred to as a <strong>computer system</strong>. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a <u>computer network</u> or <u>computer cluster.</u></p>
